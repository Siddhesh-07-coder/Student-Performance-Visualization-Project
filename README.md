\# Student Performance Visualization Project (Matplotlib + Seaborn)



\## Objective

Analyze how student behavior (self-study hours, attendance, participation) relates to academic performance using data visualization.



\## Tools Used

\- Python

\- Pandas

\- Matplotlib

\- Seaborn



\## Dataset Overview

\- Rows: ~1,000,000

\- Key columns: weekly\_self\_study\_hr, attendance\_percentage, class\_participation, total\_score, grade



\## Visualizations Included

\- Histogram (Score distribution)

\- Bar chart (Average score by grade)

\- Scatter plot (Study hours vs score)

\- Boxplot (Score distribution by grade)

\- Correlation heatmap

\- Subplots (combined insights)



\## Key Insights

\- Weekly self-study hours showing a strong positive correlation with total score.

\- Median scores decreases consistently from grade A to grade F.

\- Attendance percentage and class participation showing negligible correlation with total score in this dataset.

\- Higher grades showing tighter score distributions, while lower grades showing wider variability.
